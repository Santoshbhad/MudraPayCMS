Best practice!

This is a good place to put all frontend stuff including npm modules, sass components and so on.

After building this frontend stuff, generated css, js and other files
have to appears in /jobcase-theme/src/main/resources/jobcase-theme folder to be available for the Magnolia.

The building process can be run from the maven by using some plugins.
